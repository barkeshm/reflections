How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value does it offer?

It allows you to check and see what you decide to commit. it is separate from the two and 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

git add 'the name of the file'
	This adds the file to be added to the staging area

git commit
	adds whatever was in the staging area to be committed and then add a commit message that represents that change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When you and collaboratoirs want to work on similar master branch but not have the work convolute. Branches help things stay separate and allow for different logical elements to be adjusted - make a new branch for every feature and bug fix. each can checkout their own branch. Once a feature is made, can  update master to point to tip of new branch or combine it with current master using merge feature  

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Allows you to see what is going on in terms of commit structure
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	The merged branch will have all of the commits from the two branches recorded in the master branch which has the new commit. The merged branch can now be deleted. The resulting commit will have files that the two last commits had in common. Then if there seems to be a subtraction from the origin of the divergence, the newest merged commit will omit that and instead keep the newest developmnents on both ends. We represent it the way we do because both branches that were merged together end up being the parent commits.
